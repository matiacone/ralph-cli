Review the open/incomplete tasks and ensure they are still relevant and up to date with the current codebase state.

For each incomplete task:
1. Check if the task is still needed (hasn't been done elsewhere, isn't obsolete due to codebase changes)
2. Verify the description and acceptance criteria are still accurate
3. Check if dependencies or related code have changed in ways that affect the task

Actions to take:
- If a task has already been completed elsewhere, mark it as complete (set "passes": true)
- If a task is no longer relevant, remove it from the list
- If a task's description is outdated, update it to reflect current requirements
- If you notice gaps or new work needed, suggest adding new tasks

After reviewing, update the tasks file with your changes and summarize what was updated.

Review the changes made in the last iteration:
1. Check if any issues were introduced (bugs, regressions, incomplete work)
2. Verify the task was actually completed, not just claimed as complete
3. If follow-up work is needed, add new tasks to the tasks file with "passes": false
4. If everything looks good, proceed without changes

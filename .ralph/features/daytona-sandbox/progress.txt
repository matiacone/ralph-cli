[2026-01-14T00:01:00Z] Task: Add git helper functions to lib.ts | Added getGitRemoteUrl() and getCurrentBranch() functions using Bun.$`` shell commands with descriptive error handling for git failures. | Gotchas: none
[2026-01-14T05:38:00Z] Task: Refactor runner.ts to use Executor abstraction | Modified runner.ts to accept optional executor in config, use executor.execute() and executor.readFile(), added SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers for cleanup, and wrapped main loop in try/finally block for cleanup. | Gotchas: none
[2026-01-14T06:15:00Z] Task: Implement DaytonaExecutor | Added @daytonaio/sdk dependency and created src/executors/daytona.ts implementing Executor interface. initialize() creates sandbox with env vars and clones repo, execute() runs claude with streaming via getSessionCommandLogs callbacks, readFile() downloads files from sandbox, cleanup() deletes sandbox. | Gotchas: SessionExecuteResponse.cmdId and Command.exitCode are optional types requiring null checks
[2026-01-14T07:02:00Z] Task: Create executor factory and exports | Created src/executors/index.ts with createExecutor() factory function that returns LocalExecutor by default or DaytonaExecutor when sandbox: true with repoUrl and branch. Also re-exports Executor types and classes for convenient importing. | Gotchas: none

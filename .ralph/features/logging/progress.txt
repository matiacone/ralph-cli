[2026-01-12T10:00:00Z] Task: Add logging helper functions to lib.ts | Added getLogFilePath() and appendToLog() functions to lib.ts. getLogFilePath returns feature-specific or backlog log paths, appendToLog writes timestamped entries with proper append behavior. | Gotchas: Bun.write doesn't have an append option, so we read existing content and concatenate before writing.
[2026-01-12T11:15:00Z] Task: Integrate logging into feature streaming | Added appendToLog() calls to both single-iteration and autonomous loop modes in feature() function. Added session markers at start of each iteration. | Gotchas: none
[2026-01-12T12:30:00Z] Task: Integrate logging into backlog streaming | Added appendToLog() calls to both single-iteration (--once) and autonomous loop modes in backlog() function. Session markers written at start of each iteration, all chunks logged to .ralph/ralph.log. | Gotchas: none
[2026-01-12T19:10:00Z] Task: Add session markers to logs | Session markers were already implemented in previous tasks. Verified that all 4 streaming locations (feature --once, feature loop, backlog --once, backlog loop) write session markers with iteration numbers and visual separators (60 equals signs). | Gotchas: none
[2026-01-12T19:30:00Z] Task: Verify logging works end-to-end | Ran bun test (26 tests pass), verified types check, confirmed log file at .ralph/features/logging/ralph.log has ISO timestamps, session markers with iteration numbers, and appends correctly across multiple runs. | Gotchas: none

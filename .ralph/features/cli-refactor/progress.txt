[2026-01-13T03:10:05Z] Task: Extract shared utilities to src/ | Created src/colors.ts, src/formatter.ts, and src/auto-update.ts, updated cli.ts to import from new modules. All tests pass and types check. | Gotchas: Need to keep `import { $ } from "bun"` in cli.ts since setup() still uses it.
[2026-01-12T14:30:00Z] Task: Create the iteration runner abstraction | Created src/runner.ts with runSingleIteration and runLoop functions. Refactored feature() and backlog() in cli.ts to use the new runner, reducing each from ~100 lines to ~40 lines. | Gotchas: none
[2026-01-12T21:15:00Z] Task: Extract command handlers to src/commands/ | Created 8 command files (setup, feature, backlog, watch, status, list, cancel, help) in src/commands/ and src/completions.ts. Refactored cli.ts to a 72-line entry point that imports and dispatches to commands. All tests pass. | Gotchas: list.ts needs `import { $ } from "bun"` for stat command
[2026-01-13T03:25:00Z] Task: Refactor cli.ts to thin entry point | Moved argument parsing for feature and watch commands from cli.ts into their respective command files. Reduced cli.ts from 72 to 55 lines, making it a pure dispatcher with no command logic. | Gotchas: none
